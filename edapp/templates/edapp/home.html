    <h2>Lack of Accessible Education</h2>
    <p>
        Some people have plenty of intelligent potensial and creative ideas, 
        but they can’t activate that potensial; 
        they don’t have easy access to education. 
        These people could solve real-world issues or work a better job than they do, 
        but they are limited to the education resources provided to them, 
        and the money they have. 
        Public elementary/middle/high school is provided completely for free in Canada, 
        but post-secondary education is a different story: It is extremely expensive. 
        That is the problem: People can’t afford it.
